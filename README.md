## Project Flow:

1. **User Authentication**: Users must log in or sign up to access the portfolio creation functionality. This is handled by `index.php`, which manages user sessions and redirects unauthorized users to the login page.

2. **Portfolio Form**: Once logged in, users are directed to `form.php`, where they fill out a form with their personal and professional details, including name, email, phone number, skills, services, etc.

3. **Template Selection**: After filling out the form, users can select a template from the available options. The selected template determines the layout, styling, and overall design of the portfolio.

4. **Portfolio Generation**: Upon selecting a template and submitting the form, `generateportfolio.php` dynamically constructs the portfolio HTML using the chosen template and the user's input data.

5. **Portfolio Preview**: Users can preview the generated portfolio and make any necessary edits or adjustments before finalizing it.

6. **Portfolio Download/Share**: Once satisfied with the portfolio, users can download it as a file or share the link with others for viewing.

## Technologies Used:

- **PHP**: Server-side scripting language for dynamic content generation.
- **HTML/CSS**: Markup and styling for the portfolio webpages.
- **JavaScript/jQuery**: Enhancing interactivity and functionality.
- **000webhost**: Hosting platform for seamless deployment and accessibility.
